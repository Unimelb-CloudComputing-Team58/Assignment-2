Greenspace is a collection of tables that capture greenspace points, lines and polygons of parks, reserves and open space. The data is from the August 2019 release of Transport and Topography.\n<br><br>\n\nThe Transport and Topography dataset is comprised of three themes: Transport, Hydrology and Greenspace. The Transport and Topography dataset is used as a basis for the Geocoded National Address File (G-NAF) dataset provided by PSMA Australia. The dataset incorporates state boundaries and localities derived from the Administrative Boundaries dataset. The common geometric base allows users to apply the spatial data to the full extent of coverage.\n<br><br>\n\nFor more information, please refer to the <a href='https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/iy4ns4YETcL5ybH' target='_blank'>Product Description</a>.\n<br><br>\n\nNote: On 1 October 2020, PSMA Australia Limited began trading as Geoscape Australia.\n<br><br> Transport and Topography is designed to meet the needs of organisations that require a graphical representation of locations of the transport networks (roads, rail and airports), waterways (farm dams through to major rivers and oceans), and green spaces (local laying fields and parks, through to state and national parks) to integrate with other data in servicing their business needs.\n<br><br> AURIN has merged the State/Territory based shapefiles into a national dataset, and has joined attributes from complementary textual attribute tables.","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"greenspace_pid","type":"String","title":"Unique ID","description":"The Persistent Identifier is unique to the real world feature this record represents.","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"greenspace_name","type":"String","title":"Greenspace Name","description":"Name of the greenspace.","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"greenspace_label_name","type":"String","title":"Greenspace Label","description":"Name given to the greenspace feature in title case.","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"greenspace_class_code","type":"String","title":"Greenspace Class Code","description":"The greenspace class code (BDG007002 = ARBORETUM, LMU001003 = ORCHARD, LMU001004 = PLANTATION, LMU001005 = VINEYARD, LMU001006 = NURSERY PLANT, GARDEN OR HORTICULTURE FACILITY, LMU002001 = CAMP GROUND, LMU002002 = CARAVAN PARK, LMU006 = RECREATIONAL RESOURCE, LMU006001 = OUTDOOR THEATRE INCLUDES AMPHITHEATRE, OUTDOOR THEATRE, DRIVE-IN THEATRE, LMU006008 = GRANDSTAND, LMU006009 = GROUP CAMP, LMU006011 = OFF ROAD VEHICLE AREA, LMU006012 = PICNIC AREA PICNIC SITE OR AREA, LMU006013 = PLAYGROUND, LMU006016 = SKATE PARK, LMU007 = RESERVE, LMU007002 = BIOSPHERE RESERVE, LMU007003 = CEMETERY, LMU007005 = COASTAL RESERVE, LMU007006 = CONSERVATION PARK, LMU007007 = GAME RESERVE, LMU007008 = GARDENS GARDENS OR BOTANIC GARDEN, LMU007009 = HISTORIC RESERVE, LMU007010 = INDIGENOUS PROTECTED AREA, LMU007011 = KARST CONSERVATION RESERVE, LMU007012 = AQUATIC RESERVE MARINE PARK OR AQUATIC RESERVE, LMU007013 = NATIONAL PARK, LMU007014 = PARK, LMU007015 = PROTECTED AREA, LMU007016 = RAMSAR WETLANDS AREA, LMU007017 = FOREST RESERVE STATE FOREST OR FOREST RESERVE, LMU007018 = WILDERNESS AREA WILDERNESS PARK OR AREA, LMU007019 = ZOO ZOO OR ZOOLOGICAL GARDEN, LMU007021 = WILDLIFE SANCTUARY, LMU007022 = OPEN SPACE, LMU008002 = ATHLETIC FIELD ATHLETIC FIELD OR TRACK, LMU008005 = BOWLING GREEN, LMU008006 = CROQUET GREEN, LMU008007 = DOG TRACK DOG OR GREYHOUND TRACK, LMU008009 = GOLF COURSE, LMU008010 = GOLF DRIVING RANGE, LMU008012 = HOCKEY GROUND, LMU008013 = HORSE TRACK, LMU008014 = MOTOR TRACK RACETRACK, LMU008015 = NETBALL COURT, LMU008016 = OVAL INCLUDES CRICKET GROUND, LMU008017 = RACECOURSE, LMU008020 = SOCCER FIELD, LMU008023 = SPORTS GROUND SPORTS GROUND OR FIELD, PLAYING FIELD, LMU008027 = TENNIS COURT, LMU008028 = TRAINING TRACK, LMU008029 = CYCLING TRACK VELODROME OR CYCLING TRACK, LSI003004 = GRAVE).","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"state_pid","type":"String","title":"State or Territory Persistent ID","description":"State or Territory persistent identifier (1 = NSW, 2 = VIC, 3 = QLD, 4 = SA, 5 = WA, 6 = TAS, 7 = NT, 8 = ACT, 9 = Other Territories).","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"wkb_geometry","type":"Geometry","title":"Geometry","description":"Geometry field.","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false}],"filter":{"filterType":"tabular","spatial":{"bbox":[144.333634048,-38.502988016,145.878412014,-37.175098993]},"states":["2"]}}
